This folder is an attempt to apply FAIR Data principles to my research. This folder is where I will share important data I collect and am able to distribute. In April 2022, Matthias Scheffler and colleagues argued in Nature that FAIR principles are "a must" so that data mining and artificial intelligence can extract useful scientific information from the data.

One early example I can imagine myself doing is collecting data about the temperature of my room over a period of time using an Arduino microcontroller with a temperature sensor and sharing the spreadsheet CSV file here.
