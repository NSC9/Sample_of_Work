To prove to myself I am good at the programming language Python v3.10.1

Due to the nature of software updates, new features of Python are added such as the 'walrus operator' := which my college computer science course did not cover. 

So today seems like a good day of any to take a moment and relearn my favorite programming langauge Python.

I will follow the guide https://www.csestack.org/python/
