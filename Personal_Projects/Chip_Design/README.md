Microcontroller Chip designed at 1 × 10**−9 cubic meters

Microtroller is the name of first prototype 

Every feature would be etched on a silicon wafer by a machine. Extreme Ultraviolent Photolithography is the current standard of technique for fabricating 55-100 cubic nanometer length designs. 

Microtroller prototype Jupyter Notebooks are for accurate vector space representation of our chip designs using Python and external libraries such as Sympy 'Symbolic Mathematics."
