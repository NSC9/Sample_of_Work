Microcontroller Chip designed at 1 × 10**−9 cubic meters

Microtroller would be the name of first prototype 

Every feature would be etched on a silicon wafer by a machine. Extreme Ultraviolent Photolithography is the current standard of technique for fabricating 55-100 cubic nanometer length designs. 

This code is not for the microtroller or in a low level language. This is for accurate vector space representation of our chip using Python and external libraries such as Sympy 'Symbolic Mathematics' to model our formulas and then pass the heavy duty math to lower level systems to improve performance.
