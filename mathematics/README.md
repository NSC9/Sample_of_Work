This program is designed to accelerate one's ability to solve mathematical/logical problems using pen and paper to strengthen intuition by generating random calculus expressions and answers. I use this program every day for less than 15 minutes and post example use cases on my Twitter @TheAI2C. 

#Note: 
May need to occasionally restart the Jupyter Notebook kernel

#Instructions:

pip install sympy==1.12

Add all three files to jupyter notebook directory.

mymath.py is an importable version of mathematics.ipynb

mathematics_shortened.ipynb is a jupter notebook script that runs everything in four lines of code. 

To edit the mathematical problem generator, edit mymath.py or edit mathematics.ipynb and copy the code and paste into mymath.py
