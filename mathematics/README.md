This program is designed to accelerate one's ability to solve mathematical/logical problems using pen and paper to strengthen intuition by generating random calculus expressions and answers. I use this program every day for less than 15 minutes and post example use cases on my Twitter @TheAI2C.

# Instructions:

pip install sympy==1.12

Download and move both files into your jupyter notebook directory.

mymath.py is imported, refreshed, and ran in mathematics_shortened.ipynb

To edit the mathematical problem generator, edit mymath.py, save, and restart mathematics_shortened.ipynb's kernel
