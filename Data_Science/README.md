Following the "Foundations of Data Science" textbook by Avrim Blum, John Hopcroft, and Ravindran Kannan (2019).
I will be using the Python Programming Language and the external library "Sympy" to practice some of the examples.

Textbook found in this repo and also at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/
